# Spark-Scala-RDDs-and-SparkSQL-Dataframes

Spark Lab
This lab will demonstrate how to perform web server log analysis with Spark. Log data is a very large, common data source and contains
a rich set of information. It comes from many sources, such as web, file, and compute servers, application logs, user-generated content,
and can be used for monitoring servers, improving business and customer intelligence, building recommendation systems, fraud detection,
and much more. This lab will show how to use Spark on real-world text-based production logs and fully harness the power of that data.

Spark SQL Lab
Spark SQL is a Spark module for structured data processing. It provides a programming abstraction called DataFrames and can also act as
distributed SQL query engine. This lab presents how to work with Spark SQL.
